# Comparative analysis online
This is a prototype developed by IUCN to undertake global comparative analysis for biodiversity World Heritage nominations online. This tool will enable any interested parties to carry out an initial evaluation of their proposed biodiversity site on their own, empower non specialist to understand the logical comparison framework, and potentially reduce the risk of unsuitable sites being submitted.

At the moment, this proof-of-concept product only allows the comparison of examples of global biogeography, identified broad conservation priorities and important sites that are of great biodiversity values. 

# Caveats
The gaps identified and World Heritage sites found in the same biogeographical provinces, priorities and sites of biodiversity values only indicate a spatially overlapping relationship based on the underlying data, which can help to identify under-represented areas and guide the search of potential nominations. This does not imply the identification of any Outstanding Universal Values (OUV) that a successful World Heritage nomination would need to demonstrate. For this purpose, a rigourous, comprehensive comparative study must be undertaken, taking into consideration all information beyond geospatial analyses.
